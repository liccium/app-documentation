# Providing verifiable credentials

Liccium supports the creation and issuance of verifiable credentials (VCs) to the users (holders).

By going through a short process of **Twitter verification** and/or **domain verification** verifiable credentials (VCs) will be issued by the Liccium app to the users. These VCs are linked from the declaration metadata and can be verified by anyone to increase trust and transparency of claims and attribution.
