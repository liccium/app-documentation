# Liccium B2B Engine

The Liccium B2B Declaration Engine will enable media organisations to run the Liccium application on their own servers or local network. This additional service would offer greater control, security, and efficiency for processing large amounts of media assets, without the need to upload content to the cloud.

The On-premise solution for media organisations is offering businesses a streamlined, ‘plug-and- play’ system for scalable, verifiable content declarations.

## Metadata Module

Integration with existing title management software, ETL solution (Extract, Transform, Load) to transform data from existing sources and package them for the declaration.

## ISCC Module

Robust, scalable ISCC generator service installed on-premise (or AWS), supporting bi-directional syncing of media assets to maintain updated content after embedding of  metadata or signatures into the media assets.

## Signature Module

Generating and maintaining essential key materials and digital certificates, crucial for digitally signing verifiable content declarations, ensuring the highest level of security and trustworthiness in the declaration process.

## Declaration API

API for making verifiable declarations to federated registries, both on-chain or off chain, accessible for third parties to verify the content's authenticity and credentials and to derive rights and product metadata.\
