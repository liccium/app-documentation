# Creator credentials

Liccium uses [creator credentials](https://docs.liccium.com/whitepaper/verifiable-credentials/creator-credentials-vcs) to create trust in otherwise permissionless content declarations, claims and attribution. The app supports the creation and issuance of verifiable credentials (VCs) to the users (holders).

By going through a short process of **social** and/or **domain verification,** verifiable credentials (VCs) will be issued by the Liccium app to the users. These VCs are inseparably linked from the declaration metadata and can be verified decentrally by anyone.
