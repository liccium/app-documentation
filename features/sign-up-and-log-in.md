# Sign-up and log-in

The Liccium app is a browser-based application that prioritizes user privacy and security. Instead of traditional sign-ups and log-ins utilising user name and password, we utilise wallet-based authentication.

## Using MetaMask

Users can easily sign up or log in client-side using the MetaMask wallet. Basic services of the Liccium app do not require registration with a user name or e-mail and password.&#x20;

As we introduce new features, there may be services that will require your email address, such as issuing and receiving creator credentials, receiving notifications, alerts, and updates.

## Magic&#x20;

As an alternative to MetaMask, users can choose for password-less sign-up and log-in using Magic. This service uses a Gmail account or any other email address to create a wallet that can be used to make public declarations with the Liccium app. This Magic wallet is controlled solely by the user who has control over the e-mail address used to log-in.
