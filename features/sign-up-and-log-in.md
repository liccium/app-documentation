# Sign-up and log-in

The Liccium app is a browser-based application that prioritizes user privacy and security. Instead of traditional sign-ups and log-ins utilising user name and password, we utilise wallet-based authentication.

## MetaMask

Users can easily sign up or log in client-side using the MetaMask wallet. The basic services of the Liccium app do not require registration with a name or password.&#x20;

We value your privacy. No user credentials, personal data, email addresses, or passwords are stored on Liccium servers.

As we introduce new features, there may be services that require your email address, such as: Issuing and receiving creator credentials. Receiving notifications and updates. Stay tuned for these enhancements and thank you for using the Liccium app!

## Magic&#x20;

Users can choose for password-less sign-up and log-in using Magic. It allows to use their Gmail account or any other email address to create a wallet that can be used to make public declarations. This wallet is controlled by the user who has control over the e-mail address used to log-in.
