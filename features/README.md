The MVP of the Liccium app lets users generate content-derived identifiers from the digital media assets of their original creative works.&#x20;

Users can edit the name and description of the entries, provide basic metadata, and links to licences, storefronts, or other websites.&#x20;

In the current implementation, users can select the Twitter verification and the domain verification method to receive a verifiable credential (VCs) that are bound to the declaration metadata to increase trust and transparency of claims and declarations.&#x20;

Based on these steps, users can make public declarations on the on the `Ethereum Goerli testnet` and digitally sign their declarations to ensure trust and transparency in the authenticity and integrity of content and metadata.
