# Liccium API

The Liccium API can be used to access the Liccium registry, find and verify content declarations. It provides access to cryptographically verifiable declarations of metadata, rights, licences, and credentials, creating trust in online publications, data, information, and the authenticity of the original content. Media organisations, online platforms, and social media platforms can use the API to discover and verify content, metadata, and other information.
