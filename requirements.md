# Requirements

Please reach out to us if you want to test the MVP of the Liccium app. The following pages describe what users need to start testing.&#x20;

## Browser

The MVP of the Liccium app is a browser-based application. It should work with any browser, preferably one that supports the MetaMask extension (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Opera).

## Wallet

You can either install the MetaMask browser extension to your browser: [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/)

FAQ: [https://metamask.io/faqs/](https://metamask.io/faqs/)

Alternatively, you can sign-up and log-in with your email address via Magic Connect. This authentication method will create a wallet that is fully controlled by means of the user's own email account!&#x20;

## Network selection

Both options to sign-up and log-in will appear once you enter the landing page.

If you use MetaMask to sign-up and log-in, you have to manually switch the wallet to the `Goerli testnet`.&#x20;

If you use Magic Connectto sign-up and log-in, the app will automatically switch to the `Goerli testnet`.

## Transaction fees

Remember to fund your wallet to pay for transaction fees! To make content declarations on the `Goerli testnet` you need to own native tokens of this network. If you do not have any `Goerli ETH`, you can claim tokens for testing purposes:

* Go to any Goerli Faucet, e.g.: [https://goerlifaucet.com](https://goerlifaucet.com).
* This faucet is run by [https://www.alchemy.com/](https://www.alchemy.com/), you can sign-up, no costs are involved to request funds! Alchemy is considered to be a trusted entity in the web3 space.
* After login, enter the wallet address which you will use for testing and claim `Goerli ETH`. You can either copy & paste your wallet address directly from your MetaMask wallet or click on the wallet address presented on the header bar of the Liccium app.
