Introducing Liccium – the Invention of Trust for Digital Media.&#x20;

Liccium gives creators and rightsholders an intuitive platform to digitally sign and protect their original works, building trust in ownership, attribution and authenticity of digital media content.

### Verifiable declarations

Liccium helps creators and rightsholders to generate, manage, and declare content-derived identifiers (ISCC codes) for digital media content. Using ISCC, they can inseparably bind verifiable claims – e.g. rights, licenses, and other product metadata – to the fingerprint of their digital content.&#x20;

All declarations are automatically accessible via public and federated content registries, which allow users or machines to discover, identify, and verify the authenticity and integrity of digital media content and resolve rights, licences, and other product metadata.

### Creator attribution

Digital signatures and verifiable creator credentials increase trust in assertions, claims and the authenticity of the original content and help to sufficiently identify creators and rightsholders.

### ISCC

Liccium is based on the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), a content-derived identifier, lightweight fingerprinting, and open identification system for digital media content of all media types (image, video, text, audio),  using cryptographic and similarity- preserving hashes to create a unique ID for each digital asset.&#x20;

After 5 years of work at ISO TC 46/SC 9/WG 18, in May 2024 ISO has published the ISCC as an international standard digital content identification.&#x20;

[ISO 24138:2024 – International Standard Content Code](https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html)

Using ISCC, rightsholders' claims are inseparably bound to the content without relying on watermarks or embedded metadata. This empowers any user, system, or machine with access to the digital asset to independently generate an identical or similar ISCC code, enabling the identification, comparison, and matching of digital content while assessing its integrity and authenticity. Thus, ISCC remains dependable, retaining its full range of capabilities even in scenarios where content is altered or manipulated, or when watermarks, steganographic data, or metadata is removed from the media asset.
