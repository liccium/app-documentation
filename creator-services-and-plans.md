# Creator services and plans

Liccium is an innovative application with the primary goal of promoting the widespread adoption of digitally signing and declaring content-derived ISCC codes on public blockchain networks. The platform emphasizes the inseparable binding of rights management information and other metadata, as well as ensuring publicly accessible, verifiable creator credentials are attached to these identifiers. In doing so, Liccium aims to heighten trust and transparency in claims and attestations of content declaration.

Liccium offers a diverse business model, providing plans both free and premium, to cater to the varying needs of creators and rightsholders. This approach signifies the platform's dedication to accessibility and inclusivity, aiming to minimize any barriers to entry.

## The Basic Plan

The Basic Plan is tailored for creators just embarking on their journey. It's available at no cost and allows users to make unlimited non-custodial declarations using their wallets. The platform offers media hosting and pinning, but with a limit up to 2 GB of data. Additionally, users benefit from access to two free plugins, expanding the app's base functionalities.

## The Premium Plan

For those seeking a bit more, the Premium Plan is designed for individual creators and comes at a price of €15 per month. With this plan, users can make unlimited content declarations and enjoy the convenience of FIAT payments, eliminating the need for managing cryptocurrencies. The storage space for media hosting and pinning jumps up to 100 GB, all in high resolution. Premium users also gain access to enhanced plugins, further augmenting their experience.

## The Pro Plan

Professionals in the field might opt for The Pro Plan, curated with advanced features in mind and priced at €30 per month. It encompasses everything the Premium Plan offers but adds a series of advanced features. This includes custodial declarations, which facilitate content declaration without needing an individual wallet, and the ability to make bulk declarations. Professionals also appreciate the option of having multiple user accounts, and they're provided with a generous 200 GB of high-resolution storage space.

## The Enterprise Plan

Lastly, The Enterprise Plan is tailored for media organizations. While the pricing for this plan is custom, and those interested would need to discuss specifics with Liccium, it boasts a host of features. This plan includes unlimited non-custodial declarations and accepts traditional FIAT payments. The media hosting and pinning are custom-tailored to the needs of the organization. Access to premium plugins, custodial and bulk declarations, and the ability to manage multiple accounts makes this plan particularly attractive. A standout feature is the Liccium VM, which allows media organizations to run Liccium directly on their premises, sidestepping the need to upload content externally.

Liccium, with its varied plans, strives to be a one-stop solution for all creators, regardless of their stature or needs, emphasizing convenience, flexibility, and control over content declarations.
