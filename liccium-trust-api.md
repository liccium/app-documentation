# Liccium Trust API

The Liccium Trust API can be used to access the decentralised registry, find and verify all content declarations. It provides access to cryptographically verifiable declarations of metadata, rights, licences, and credentials, creating trust in online publications, data, information, and the authenticity of the original content. Media organisations, online platforms, and social media platforms can use the API to discover and verify content, metadata, and other information.

By means of the Liccium Trust API, media organisations and platforms can integrate the verification and discovery functionalities into their own existing architecture and workflows. Among other advantages this would also make it much easier to verify user generated content uploaded to their websites and platforms. Fake news, illegitimate or unauthorised content can be identified and removed.
